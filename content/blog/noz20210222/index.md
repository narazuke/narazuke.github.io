## 日課

### 早起き

ちょっとできた。  
アラーム 6:30 に止めたけど、8:30 ぐらいに布団から出た。  
PC の電源切ったらスマホいじらずに就寝態勢に入りたいよね。

### 散歩

行ってきた。  
9:10 から 9:20 まで。  
かなり暖かくなった。春の訪れを覚える。  
「今日はは暖かいですね」と近所の人に話しかけられた。  
「そうですね、ニュースでも季節を先取りとか言ってましたもんね」と応えた。

[Virtual Babysitting Services in Demand for Working Parents in UK | Daily News Article](https://www.rarejob.com/dna/2021/02/22/virtual-babysitting-services-in-demand-for-working-parents-in-uk/)

#### My summary

Many parents in the UK have resorted to virtual nanny service in the country. The service is designed to help parents focus on work while someone watching over their children through video call.  
The feedback of the service is varied from parents. Some said that it got easy for her to leave children alone with the nanny over time. Other said that it isn't suitable for everyone and virtual interaction might not be replaced with face-to-face interaction.
