## 日課

### 早起き

まあまあできた。  
今日は寒くてお布団から出るのが辛かった。  
お腹を冷やしたのか分からないけど腸があまり良くない感じです。

### 散歩

行ってきた。  
7:40~7:55 まで。寒いしお腹痛いし玄関出た瞬間から帰りたいなと思った。  
数年ぶりに近所の公園にいった。
小さい頃よくジュースを買っていた自販機が無くなっていて、ちょっと悲しい。

### 歯磨き

昨夜も今朝もした。  
スマホは持ち込んでしまったが、鋼の意志で触らなかった。

[Study: Unknown Illness Likely Caused by Microwave Radiation
| Daily News Article](https://www.rarejob.com/dna/2021/02/23/study-unknown-illness-likely-caused-by-microwave-radiation/)

#### My summary

Some American employees of US embassy in Cuba experienced symptoms like hearing strange sounds, ear pain, vision problems and vertigo. The unusal set of symptoms was named Havana Syndrome.  
The experts supposed that the symptoms might have caused by 4 factors: chemical exposure, infections, psycological issues and microwave exprosure.  
Some of them thought that microwave radiation seemed the most plausible cause of the syndrome. The researchers emphasized that they were only speculating the cause of the illness and that incestigations were still underway.

#### Discussions

**Apart from providing long-term emergency medical services, do you think the US government should do more for the American employees affected by Havana Syndrome?**  
Yes, I think so. US government should provide them subsidies because the symptoms will interrupt their works.

**Do you think the American employees with Havana Syndrome were intentionally attacked by someone? Why or why not?**
No, I don't think so. It is a suspicious story. A conflict between two countries since the cold war might evoke such unfounded rumor.

#### New words
